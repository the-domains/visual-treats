            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Livestream's Mevo camera lets you edit video on the fly</h1><p>My first thought upon hearing about the camera, which was officially introduced at Facebook's F8 conference earlier this week, was: Who exactly is Livestream targeting here? Facebook Live video has boomed in a big way with people shooting on their phones, and lots of those users aren't going to shell out for a $399 external camera.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4466be094e86bad9c0e2fe4c5a74c3d32ef5c016.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Illustration</h1><p>As part of his Celestial Series, Chicago-based digital artist David Brodeur rendered an alien world filled with berry-like plants, glowing crystals, and candy shaped orbs that sprout from the ground. Despite their exotic designs, Brodeur relies on common colors of familiar fruits to create this Willy Wonka-esque habitat where you can't help but want to reach out and gobble everything up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4d6c337dd3c98bcadd87c6b27fd94f1493ae65eb.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>There & Back Again: A Cross-Country Epic</h1><p>It's usually late February or early March when I load up my vehicle with tools of photographic wonder to embark on a journey from Asheville, NC into the unknown and across the U.S. Destination: Las Vegas. WPPI to be exact, where I have been an educator there since 2002.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a8b9656e1adc0b7119ac419bcd54748f5ecfdf92.jpg"></article>]]></description>
